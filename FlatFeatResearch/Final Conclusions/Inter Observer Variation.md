**Plot 1: Bland-Altman_1MTA_T1_KP_vs_KT**
- This plot compares two different measurement methods for some value, labeled **"1MTA_T1_KP"** and **"1MTA_T1_KT"**.
- The **red horizontal line** represents the mean difference between the two measurement methods. It is very close to zero, which suggests there is **very little to no systematic bias**. This means, on average, one method does not consistently produce a higher or lower value than the other.
- The **two blue dashed lines** represent the **95% limits of agreement**, which are approximately from **-82 to +108**. These limits define the range within which the differences between the two methods are expected to fall for 95% of the measurements.
- The majority of the data points are clustered near the mean difference line, showing **good agreement** for most measurements. However, there are two notable clusters of **outliers** with large differences. These points fall far outside the 95% limits of agreement, indicating **significant discrepancies** between the two methods for these specific measurements. These outliers could be due to measurement errors, data entry mistakes, or other factors that warrant further investigation.
- The plot shows a clear pattern where the difference between the two methods **increases as the magnitude of the measurement increases**. The points are not randomly scattered; instead, they appear to diverge from the mean difference line at higher values. This suggests that the **agreement between the two methods is not consistent** across the range of measured values, and the methods agree less well for larger measurements.

**Plot 2: Bland-Altman_1MTA_T2_KP_vs_KT**
- This plot compares two different measurement methods, labeled **"1MTA_T2_KP"** and **"1MTA_T2_KT"**.
- The **red horizontal line**, representing the mean difference, is slightly below zero. This indicates a **slight systematic bias**, suggesting that on average, one measurement method consistently yields a slightly lower value than the other.
- The **two blue dashed lines** represent the **95% limits of agreement**, which are approximately from **-9.5 to +8.5**. These lines define the range within which the differences between the two methods are expected to fall for 95% of the measurements.
- The majority of the data points fall within the limits of agreement, showing **good agreement** between the two methods. There are no obvious outliers that fall far outside the 95% limits.
- The plot shows no clear pattern where the difference increases or decreases as the magnitude of the measurement increases. The points appear to be **randomly scattered** around the mean difference line, suggesting that the **agreement between the two methods is consistent** across the range of measured values.

**Plot 3: Bland-Altman_5MTCA_T1_KP_vs_KT**
- This plot compares two different measurement methods, labeled **"5MTCA_T1_KP"** and **"5MTCA_T1_KT"**.
- The **red horizontal line** is very close to zero, suggesting a **very small systematic bias**. On average, there is very little difference between the two measurement methods.
- The **two blue dashed lines** represent the **95% limits of agreement**, which are approximately from **-9.5 to +8.5**. This is the range within which the differences between the two methods are expected to fall for 95% of the measurements.
- Most data points are within the limits of agreement, indicating **good agreement** between the two methods. There is one data point around x=22 with a difference of approximately -10, which falls just outside the 95% limits. This may be an outlier or a measurement that warrants further investigation.
- The plot shows no clear pattern where the difference increases or decreases as the magnitude of the measurement increases. The points are **randomly scattered** around the mean difference line, suggesting that the **agreement between the two methods is consistent** across the range of measured values.

**Plot 4: Bland-Altman_5MTCA_T2_KP_vs_KT**
- This plot compares two different measurement methods, labeled **"5MTCA_T2_KP"** and **"5MTCA_T2_KT"**.
- The **red horizontal line** is very close to zero, meaning there is **very little to no systematic bias**. This indicates that, on average, the two measurement methods yield very similar results.
- The **two blue dashed lines** represent the **95% limits of agreement**, which are approximately from **-10 to +9.5**. This is the range within which the differences between the two methods are expected to fall for 95% of the measurements.
- The majority of the data points are within the limits of agreement, showing **good agreement** for most measurements. However, there is one **outlier** around x=27 with a difference greater than 15. This point falls far outside the 95% limits of agreement, suggesting a **significant discrepancy** between the two methods for this particular measurement. This outlier could be a data entry error, a measurement error, or an actual physiological difference that warrants further investigation.
- The plot shows no obvious pattern where the difference increases or decreases as the magnitude of the measurement increases. The points appear **randomly scattered** around the mean difference line, suggesting that the **agreement between the two methods is consistent** across the range of measured values.

**Plot 5: bland_altman_cal_PA_T1_KP_vs_KT**
- This plot compares two different measurement methods for some value, labeled "cal_PA_T1_KP" and "cal_PA_KT". The measurements are of CAL pitch angle, done by Dr. KP and Dr. KT.
- The **red horizontal line** is very close to zero, meaning there is very little to no **systematic bias**. This means, on average, one measurement does not consistently give a higher or lower value than the other.
- The **two blue dashed lines** represent the **95% limits of agreement**. In this plot, the limits of agreement are roughly from -7 to +7. This tells you the range within which the differences between the two methods are likely to fall for any given measurement.
- Most data points are clustered around the mean difference line, showing **good agreement** for most measurements. However, there's one notable **outlier** around x=14, with a difference greater than 15. This point falls far outside the 95% limits of agreement, suggesting a **significant discrepancy** between the two methods for this particular measurement. This outlier could be a data entry error, a measurement error, or an actual physiological difference that warrants further investigation.
- The plot does not show any obvious pattern where the difference increases or decreases as the magnitude of the measurement increases. The points appear randomly scattered around the mean difference line, suggesting that the **agreement between the two methods is consistent** across the range of measured values.

**Plot 6: bland_altman_cal_PA_T2_KP_vs_KT**
- This plot compares two different measurement methods for a value, labeled "cal_PA_T2_KP" and "cal_PA_T2_KT". The measurements are of CAL pitch angle, specifically for time point T2, done by Dr. KP and Dr. KT.
- The **red horizontal line** is slightly below zero but very close to it, indicating **minimal systematic bias**. On average, there is a very small, consistent difference between the measurements from the two doctors.
- The **two blue dashed lines** represent the **95% limits of agreement**. These limits are approximately from -6 to +5, which is a fairly wide range. This suggests that for any given measurement, the difference between the two doctors' readings could be up to 6 units in one direction and 5 in the other.
- The data points are mostly clustered around the mean difference line, but there are a few notable **outliers** outside the 95% limits of agreement, specifically around x=5 and x=10. This indicates significant discrepancies between the two methods for these particular measurements, which may warrant further investigation.
- The scatter of the points does not show a clear pattern where the differences increase or decrease with the magnitude of the measurement, suggesting that the **agreement is consistent** across the range of measured values. However, the presence of outliers indicates that while agreement is generally good, there are instances where the methods diverge significantly.
