| -- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 1  | **LL\_mean**       | Excellent separation, best discriminator | ✅ Strongest single cluster-based predictor      |
| 2  | **cal\_PA\_mean**  | Strong separation, clear shift left      | ⚡ Very good visual separation                   |
| 3  | **ML\_mean**       | Good separation, distinct peaks          | ⚡ Useful, though not top performer              |
| 4  | **1MTA\_mean**     | Moderate separation, right tail visible  | ✅ Good indicator, supports statistical strength |
| 5  | **MT\_calA\_mean** | Reasonable separation, some overlap      | ⚠️ Moderate relevance, possible secondary role  |
| 6  | **MA\_mean**       | Heavy overlap, weak separator            | ❌ Weak cluster distinction                      |
| 7  | **TCA\_mean**      | Significant overlap, poor separator      | ❌ Weak distinction between 0s and 1s            |
| 8  | **TUA\_mean**      | Heavy overlap, nearly identical          | ❌ Minimal discriminatory power                  |
| 9  | **5MTCA\_mean**    | Almost complete overlap, very poor       | ❌ Negligible predictive value                   |
| 10 | **MCL\_mean**      | Complete overlap, useless                | ❌ No usable separation                          |
| 11 | **MCL\_var**       | Spike at zero, useless                   | ❌ Feature carries no variability information    |
| 12 | **1MTA\_var**      | Spike at zero, useless                   | ❌ No meaningful separation                      |
| 13 | **MT\_calA\_var**  | Spike at zero, useless                   | ❌ No contribution visually                      |
| 14 | **ML\_var**        | Spike at zero, useless                   | ❌ No usable variation                           |
| 15 | **MA\_var**        | Spike at zero, useless                   | ❌ No useful signal                              |
| 16 | **LL\_var**        | Spike at zero, useless                   | ❌ Not informative                               |
| 17 | **5MTCA\_var**     | Spike at zero, useless                   | ❌ Redundant                                     |
| 18 | **cal\_PA\_var**   | Spike at zero, useless                   | ❌ No valuable information                       |
| 19 | **TUA\_var**       | Spike at zero, useless                   | ❌ Uninformative                                 |
