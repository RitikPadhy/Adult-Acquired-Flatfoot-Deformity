# 🔍 Cluster-Based Feature Interpretation Summary

The table below summarizes how each radiographic feature behaves with respect to the target variable (0 = No AAFD, 1 = AAFD) based on KDE cluster visualizations. Key points about this approach:

- Each feature is plotted on the x-axis, with the density distributions of 0s and 1s overlaid.
- The degree of overlap between the distributions indicates how well the feature can separate the two classes.
- Clear separation or shifts → feature strongly discriminates between conditions (clinically meaningful predictor).
- Heavy overlap or spikes at zero → feature has low or no discriminatory power.

This analysis visually identifies which measurements could independently serve as dominant or weak predictors before performing deeper statistical analysis (e.g., correlation or model-based feature importance).
