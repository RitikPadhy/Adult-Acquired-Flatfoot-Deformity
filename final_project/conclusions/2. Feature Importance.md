# 📊 Feature Importance Interpretation Using Correlation, MI, and Random Forest

To complement the visual cluster-based analysis, we also evaluate each radiographic feature quantitatively using three statistical/machine learning metrics:

1. Correlation (Point-Biserial)

- Measures the linear association between each continuous feature and the binary target (0 = No AAFD, 1 = AAFD).
- Values close to +1 or -1 indicate a strong linear relationship; values near 0 indicate little to no linear link.
- Helps identify features that linearly differentiate between target classes.

2. Mutual Information (MI)

- Quantifies the amount of information shared between a feature and the target.
- Captures non-linear dependencies that correlation might miss.
- Higher MI indicates the feature provides more predictive information about the target.

3. Random Forest (RF) Feature Importance

- Derived from a trained Random Forest classifier, showing how much each feature contributes to reducing impurity in decision splits.
- High RF importance implies the feature is influential in tree-based models, even if it has weak linear correlation.

## How to interpret these metrics together:

- Features with high correlation, MI, and RF importance are strong, consistent predictors and can often serve as dominant parameters.
- Features with moderate MI but low correlation may capture non-linear effects, useful in combination with other features.
- Features with low values across all metrics have limited predictive value.

By considering all three metrics, we can identify which radiographic measurements are most relevant for predicting AAFD and prioritize them for clinical focus.
