# 🔑 Feature Insights: Cluster + Importance

We analyzed each radiographic feature using both cluster separation and statistical/model-based metrics.

    - Cluster Separation: Shows how well 0s (no AAFD) and 1s (AAFD) are visually separated.
    - Metrics (Correlation, MI, RF Importance): Quantify linear and non-linear associations as well as predictive contribution.

By combining both, we can interpret which features are strong predictors and which are weak.
