# 📊 Evaluation Metrics Explanation & Insights

- Precision (0 & 1): Measures how many predicted samples for each class are correct. High precision for class 1 shows the model predicts AAFD cases accurately; low precision for class 0 in early subsets indicates many false positives for non-AAFD.
- Recall (0 & 1): Measures how many actual samples were correctly identified. High recall for class 1 shows most AAFD cases are detected; low recall for class 0 indicates many non-AAFD cases are missed initially.
- F1 (0 & 1): Harmonic mean of precision and recall. Reflects balance between detecting and predicting each class. Early subsets have poor F1 for class 0, improving as more features are added.
- Macro F1: Average of F1 scores across classes, treating them equally. Shows overall model balance.
- Weighted F1: Average F1 weighted by class support. Indicates overall model performance considering class distribution.
- AUC: Measures the ability to distinguish between classes. Values close to 1 indicate excellent discrimination, even with few top features.

## Key Takeaways from Results:

- Top features drive predictive power: LL_mean and 1MTA_mean alone achieve high class 1 metrics and AUC, showing they capture most of the signal.
- Class 0 detection improves with more features: Adding incremental features increases precision and recall for non-AAFD cases, highlighting subtle distinctions.
- Class 1 detection remains robust: Metrics for AAFD cases stay high across subsets, indicating strong discriminative ability of top features.
- Balanced F1 shows generalization: Macro and weighted F1 rise with additional informative features, suggesting better model generalization.
- AUC confirms class separability: High AUC across subsets demonstrates effective separation between classes even with few features.
- Too many features may introduce noise: Very large subsets sometimes lower class 0 metrics slightly due to redundant or weak features.
- Small feature subsets are sufficient: Top 2–3 features achieve near-optimal performance, showing diminishing returns from extra features.
