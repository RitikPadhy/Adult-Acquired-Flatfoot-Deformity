# 📌 Final Conclusions

- The model is highly effective at predicting AAFD (class 1) even with just the top features (LL_mean, 1MTA_mean).
- Incremental features help detect non-AAFD (class 0) better, improving overall balance but adding limited extra predictive value.
- Top 2–3 features capture most of the predictive signal, so using all 20 features is often unnecessary.
- Balanced F1 and AUC confirm generalization: the model performs consistently across both classes and avoids overfitting on a few features.
- Including too many features can slightly reduce precision/recall for class 0, indicating potential noise or redundancy.
- Overall, feature selection based on cluster separation + importance metrics is effective, allowing for simpler, interpretable models with strong predictive performance.
