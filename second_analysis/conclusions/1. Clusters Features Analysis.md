# 🔍 Cluster-Based Feature Interpretation Summary

The table below summarizes how each radiographic feature behaves with respect to the target variable (0 = No AAFD, 1 = AAFD) based on KDE cluster visualizations. Key points about this approach:

- Each feature is plotted on the x-axis, with the density distributions of 0s and 1s overlaid.
- The degree of overlap between the distributions indicates how well the feature can separate the two classes.
- Clear separation or shifts → feature strongly discriminates between conditions (clinically meaningful predictor).
- Heavy overlap or spikes at zero → feature has low or no discriminatory power.

This analysis visually identifies which measurements could independently serve as dominant or weak predictors before performing deeper statistical analysis (e.g., correlation or model-based feature importance).

| 1 | **5MTCA_pure_inter_second** | Most Relevant | The target=1 distribution (orange) is highly distinct from the target=0 distribution (blue). The mean of target=1 is significantly shifted to the right (positive values), and there's very little overlap, suggesting this feature is highly predictive for target=1. |
| 2 | **5MTCA_pure_inter_first** | Most Relevant | Similar to (8,2), the target=1 distribution (orange) is highly separated, though slightly less than (8,2). The mean is shifted significantly to the right, indicating strong predictive power for target=1. |
| 3 | **cal_PA_pure_inter_second** | Most Relevant | The target=1 distribution (orange) shows a strong, clear separation from target=0, with its mean shifted noticeably to the right. This feature is highly effective at distinguishing the classes. |
| 4 | **cal_PA_pure_inter_first** | Most Relevant | Similar to (9,2), the distributions are strongly separated. Target=1 (orange) is shifted to the right. This feature has high predictive power. |
| 5 | **MT_calA_pure_inter_first** | High Relevance | The distributions show a clear and useful separation. Target=1 (orange) has its peak shifted to the right compared to target=0 (blue), indicating a good degree of predictability. |
| 6 | **TCA_pure_inter_second** | High Relevance | The target=1 (orange) distribution is clearly shifted to the right with respect to target=0 (blue), resulting in a good separation and moderate overlap. |
| 7 | **TCA_pure_inter_first** | High Relevance | The distributions are visibly separated, with the target=1 (orange) curve shifted to the right, offering significant utility in classification. |
| 8 | **TCA_pure_intra_obs1** | Medium Relevance | There is a noticeable separation with target=1 (orange) shifted to the right, but the distributions still overlap considerably around the center. |
| 9 | **MA_pure_inter_first** | Medium Relevance | Target=1 (orange) is shifted to the right of target=0 (blue). The features are distinct enough to be useful, but the overlap is substantial. |
| 10 | **MA_pure_inter_second** | Medium Relevance | Target=1 (orange) is shifted to the right of target=0 (blue). The features are distinct enough to be useful, but the overlap is substantial. |
| 11 | **5MTCA_pure_intra_obs1** | Medium Relevance | The target=1 (orange) distribution is somewhat shifted to the right of target=0 (blue), but the overlap is considerable, making it less powerful than the "inter" features in the same row. |
| 12 | **cal_PA_pure_intra_obs1** | Medium Relevance | Target=1 (orange) is shifted slightly to the right of target=0 (blue). There is a moderate overlap, suggesting medium predictive power. |
| 13 | **MA_pure_intra_obs1** | Medium Relevance | There's a slight shift in means, with target=1 (orange) peaking slightly to the right of target=0 (blue), but the distributions are highly overlapping. |
| 14 | **MA_pure_intra_obs2** | Medium Relevance | Similar to (7,3), a slight shift with target=1 (orange) peaking slightly to the right of target=0 (blue), with high overlap. |
| 15 | **LL_pure_inter_first** | Medium Relevance | A slight difference in the shape and peaks, with target=1 (orange) appearing slightly flatter and wider, but the overlap is very high. |
| 16 | **LL_pure_inter_second** | Medium Relevance | Similar to (3,1), a slight difference in the shape and peaks, with very high overlap. |
| 17 | **MT_calA_pure_inter_second** | Low Relevance | The distributions are highly overlapping, but target=1 (orange) shows a very slight shift to the right. This feature has limited predictive utility. |
| 18 | **TUA_pure_inter_first** | Low Relevance | The distributions are almost entirely overlapping. The slight peak for target=1 (orange) around x=−1.5 is a minor differentiator. |
| 19 | **TUA_pure_inter_second** | Low Relevance | The distributions are almost entirely overlapping. The slight peak for target=1 (orange) around x=−1.5 is a minor differentiator. |
| 20 | **MCL_pure_inter_first** | Low Relevance | The distributions are highly overlapping. Target=1 (orange) shows a slight skew toward negative values, which is a minimal difference. |
