# 🔑 Feature Insights: Cluster + Importance

We analyzed each radiographic feature using both cluster separation and statistical/model-based metrics.

- Cluster Separation: Shows how well 0s (no AAFD) and 1s (AAFD) are visually separated.
- Metrics (Correlation, MI, RF Importance): Quantify linear and non-linear associations as well as predictive contribution.

By combining both, we can interpret which features are strong predictors and which are weak.

| 1  | 5MTCA\_pure\_inter\_second    | Most Relevant          | -0.15 / ∼0.00 / 1.00      | The target=1 distribution (orange) is highly distinct from the target=0 distribution (blue). The mean of target=1 is significantly shifted to the right (positive values), and there's very little overlap, suggesting this feature is highly predictive for target=1. |
