# 📌 Final Conclusions

- The model demonstrates strong predictive power for AAFD (class 1), with top features like LL_mean and 1MTA_mean capturing the bulk of the signal.
- Adding more features beyond the top 2–3 improves detection of non-AAFD (class 0) slightly but contributes diminishing returns.
- Metrics show that balanced F1 and AUC remain robust, suggesting the model generalizes well and is not overfitting to a small subset of features.
- Over-including features can introduce redundancy or noise, slightly reducing precision/recall for class 0, highlighting the importance of careful feature selection.
- Cluster separation combined with feature importance metrics (Correlation / MI / RF) proves effective for identifying high-value features.
- Overall, a compact feature set (top 3–5 features) offers strong predictive performance while keeping the model interpretable and efficient.
