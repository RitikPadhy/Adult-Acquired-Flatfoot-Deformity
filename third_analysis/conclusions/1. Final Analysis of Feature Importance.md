# 🔍 Feature Reliability Ranking (Bland–Altman Analysis)

We evaluated each radiographic feature using Bland–Altman statistics to quantify observer agreement. Features are ranked by their **Combined Score** (average across all four measurement contexts: Inter-observer T1, Inter-observer T2, Intra-observer KP, Intra-observer KT).

**Lower Combined Score = Better Reliability**

The Combined Score integrates:
- **Normalized SD**: Measures consistency (spread of differences)
- **Normalized MAD**: Measures absolute deviation magnitude
- **Normalized MeanDiff**: Measures systematic bias (though clinically less important)

## 🎯 Key Clinical Insights

### Tier 1: Clinical Gold Standard (Avg Score < 0.20)
- **LL, ML, MCL**: These features demonstrate exceptional reliability across all measurement contexts
- Recommended as **primary diagnostic features** for AAFD assessment
- Can be measured consistently by different observers and across time

### Tier 2: Supplementary Features (Avg Score 0.20-0.70)
- **MT_calA, cal_PA**: Moderate reliability, acceptable for clinical use with proper training
- Use as **secondary diagnostic indicators**
- Consider averaging multiple measurements to improve reliability

### Tier 3: Research Only (Avg Score 0.70-1.50)
- **MA, TCA, 5MTCA, TUA**: Poor to very poor reliability
- **Not recommended** for routine clinical decision-making
- May be useful in research settings with highly trained observers

### Tier 4: Not Clinically Useful (Avg Score > 1.50)
- **1MTA**: Unacceptable reliability across all contexts
- Should be **excluded** from diagnostic protocols
- High variability makes it unsuitable for clinical or research use

## 📌 Summary

**Most Reliable Features**: LL (0.0073), ML (0.1564), MCL (0.1710)
- Consistently low combined scores across all measurement contexts
- Excellent inter-observer and intra-observer agreement
- Recommended for clinical AAFD assessment

**Least Reliable Features**: TUA (1.1566), 1MTA (2.6698)
- High combined scores indicate poor measurement consistency
- Not suitable for clinical decision-making
- Should be avoided in diagnostic protocols

**Observer Performance**: KT demonstrates superior repeatability compared to KP, particularly evident in intra-observer measurements where KT achieves near-perfect scores for LL, ML, and MCL.
