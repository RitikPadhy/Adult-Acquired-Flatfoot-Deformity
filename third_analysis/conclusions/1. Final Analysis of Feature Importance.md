# 🔍 Feature Insights: Observer Agreement (Bland–Altman Analysis)

We evaluated each radiographic feature using Bland–Altman statistics to quantify observer agreement, both between observers (Inter-observer) and within the same observer across time (Intra-observer).

- Mean Difference (Bias): Average difference between the two sets of measurements. If mean difference close to zero, there is no system bias.
- SD (Standard Deviation): If SD is small, all the differences are close to each other. If SD is large, the differences jump around a lot.
- MAD (Mean Absolute Deviation): MAD ignores the sign of the differences, focuses on how the big the difference is. Low MAD - differ little on average, High MAD - large average absolute differences - less consistent measurements

Features with lowest SD and MAD demonstrate excellent reproducibility across observers.

## 🧭 Summary Insights

- Most Reliable Features: LL and ML (across both inter- and intra-observer tests) showed the lowest SD and MAD, indicating excellent measurement consistency.
- Moderately Reliable: MCL exhibited moderate agreement, suitable for comparative use but with caution.
- Least Reliable: MT_calA and cal_PA showed high variability across observers, suggesting observer-dependent interpretation or measurement complexity.

Observer KT demonstrated higher repeatability than KP overall based on the table.
